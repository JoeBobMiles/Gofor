# Gofor - A webserver written in Go

Gofor is a project I'm using to learn Go. It's currently a basic webserver that
has very little functionality other than simply serving up the same file
regardless of the request being made. Ideally I would like to make this a full
fledged webserver that can be used to serve actual websites.
